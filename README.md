### Reproducing the illustrative example of the DIM Estimator (Section 2.3)
- `dim_bias_nonlinear.ipynb` contains code for reproducing Figure 1. 

### Reproducing results in Monte Carlo Simulations (Section 4.3)
- Run `dim_ab_nonlinear.py` to generate simulation results. 
- Run `graph_visualizer.ipynb` to visualize the results.
